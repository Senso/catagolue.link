This is the code for the https://catagolue.link/stats web page (https://catagolue.link redirects to the main Catagolue website, not run by me, https://catagolue.appspot.com).

It runs a cronjob every day at 23:59 UTC that graphs the current number of distinct objects discovered in a few rulesets of Conway's Game of Life (defined in rules.txt).
